Implementing dynamic sharding with performance profiling in a cache system is an advanced topic that touches upon several key areas: system design, performance monitoring, and dynamic resource allocation. Here's a high-level approach to tackle both parts of your requirement:

### 1. Dynamic Sharding

Dynamic sharding means that the system adjusts the number of shards based on certain criteria, such as load, the number of entries, or performance metrics. This involves:

- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor each shard for performance metrics such as read/write latency, throughput, and storage.
- **Decision Logic:** Implement logic that decides when to create a new shard or merge existing ones based on the performance profile. This could be based on thresholds for the metrics mentioned above.
- **Resharding:** Safely migrating data to new shard configurations without significant downtime or performance degradation.

### 2. Performance Profile

The performance profile involves gathering, storing, and analyzing metrics related to cache operations. This can be divided into:

- **Metrics Collection:** Instrument your cache operations to collect timings for reads and writes, error rates, and other relevant metrics. This can be done using middleware or decorators around your cache operations.
- **Analysis and Decision Making:** Analyze the collected metrics to identify bottlenecks or performance issues. Use this analysis to inform the dynamic sharding logic about when to adjust the shard count.

### Implementation Sketch

Here's a conceptual sketch of how you might start implementing these features:

#### Metrics Collection

Use a lightweight, in-memory structure to track operation times and counts. For simplicity, you can use Go's `time` package to measure operation durations and atomic counters to track operation counts.

```go
type Metric struct {
    Count int64         // Number of operations
    TotalDuration int64 // Total duration of all operations in nanoseconds
}

func (m *Metric) Record(duration time.Duration) {
    atomic.AddInt64(&m.Count, 1)
    atomic.AddInt64(&m.TotalDuration, duration.Nanoseconds())
}

func (m *Metric) Average() time.Duration {
    count := atomic.LoadInt64(&m.Count)
    if count == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    totalDuration := atomic.LoadInt64(&m.TotalDuration)
    return time.Duration(totalDuration / count)
}
```

#### Dynamic Sharding Logic

- **Initialization:** Start with a single shard.
- **Monitoring Loop:** Periodically (e.g., every minute), examine the metrics of each shard.
- **Adjustment:** If a shard exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., average read/write latency or operation count), split the shard. If a shard is underutilized (based on similar metrics), consider merging it with another shard.

#### Resharding Data

Splitting a shard involves redistributing its keys among the new shard(s). This requires a mechanism to lock the shard (or parts of it) to prevent read/write operations from seeing inconsistent data during the migration.

### Considerations

- **Consistency:** Ensure that your resharding process maintains data consistency. This might involve temporarily locking shards or using more sophisticated synchronization mechanisms.
- **Performance Impact:** Resharding can be resource-intensive. Consider performing these operations during off-peak hours if possible.
- **Complexity:** Dynamic sharding adds significant complexity to your system. Make sure that the benefits outweigh the costs in terms of maintenance and potential bugs.

This is a high-level overview and starting point. Each of these steps can be quite detailed and complex, depending on your specific requirements and existing infrastructure.
