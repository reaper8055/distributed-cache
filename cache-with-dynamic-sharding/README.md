Implementing dynamic sharding with performance profiling in a cache system is an advanced topic that touches upon several key areas: system design, performance monitoring, and dynamic resource allocation. Here's a high-level approach to tackle both parts of your requirement:

### 1. Dynamic Sharding

Dynamic sharding means that the system adjusts the number of shards based on certain criteria, such as load, the number of entries, or performance metrics. This involves:

- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor each shard for performance metrics such as read/write latency, throughput, and storage.
- **Decision Logic:** Implement logic that decides when to create a new shard or merge existing ones based on the performance profile. This could be based on thresholds for the metrics mentioned above.
- **Resharding:** Safely migrating data to new shard configurations without significant downtime or performance degradation.

### 2. Performance Profile

The performance profile involves gathering, storing, and analyzing metrics related to cache operations. This can be divided into:

- **Metrics Collection:** Instrument your cache operations to collect timings for reads and writes, error rates, and other relevant metrics. This can be done using middleware or decorators around your cache operations.
- **Analysis and Decision Making:** Analyze the collected metrics to identify bottlenecks or performance issues. Use this analysis to inform the dynamic sharding logic about when to adjust the shard count.

### Implementation Sketch

Here's a conceptual sketch of how you might start implementing these features:

#### Metrics Collection

Use a lightweight, in-memory structure to track operation times and counts. For simplicity, you can use Go's `time` package to measure operation durations and atomic counters to track operation counts.

```go
type Metric struct {
    Count int64         // Number of operations
    TotalDuration int64 // Total duration of all operations in nanoseconds
}

func (m *Metric) Record(duration time.Duration) {
    atomic.AddInt64(&m.Count, 1)
    atomic.AddInt64(&m.TotalDuration, duration.Nanoseconds())
}

func (m *Metric) Average() time.Duration {
    count := atomic.LoadInt64(&m.Count)
    if count == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    totalDuration := atomic.LoadInt64(&m.TotalDuration)
    return time.Duration(totalDuration / count)
}
```

#### Dynamic Sharding Logic

- **Initialization:** Start with a single shard.
- **Monitoring Loop:** Periodically (e.g., every minute), examine the metrics of each shard.
- **Adjustment:** If a shard exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., average read/write latency or operation count), split the shard. If a shard is underutilized (based on similar metrics), consider merging it with another shard.

#### Resharding Data

Splitting a shard involves redistributing its keys among the new shard(s). This requires a mechanism to lock the shard (or parts of it) to prevent read/write operations from seeing inconsistent data during the migration.

### Considerations

- **Consistency:** Ensure that your resharding process maintains data consistency. This might involve temporarily locking shards or using more sophisticated synchronization mechanisms.
- **Performance Impact:** Resharding can be resource-intensive. Consider performing these operations during off-peak hours if possible.
- **Complexity:** Dynamic sharding adds significant complexity to your system. Make sure that the benefits outweigh the costs in terms of maintenance and potential bugs.

This is a high-level overview and starting point. Each of these steps can be quite detailed and complex, depending on your specific requirements and existing infrastructure.

### Calculating cache size at regular intervals

Implement a mechanism to calculate the cache size at regular intervals (every N seconds or minutes) in your cache system. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Periodic Cache Size Calculation

Implement a background goroutine that runs periodically to calculate the size of the cache. This goroutine can iterate through all shards and sum up the number of key-value pairs stored in each shard.

```go
import (
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// CacheSizeCalculator calculates the size of the cache at regular intervals.
type CacheSizeCalculator struct {
    shards Shard
    interval time.Duration
    stopChan chan struct{}
    mu sync.Mutex
    sizes []int // Store the calculated sizes
}

// NewCacheSizeCalculator initializes a new CacheSizeCalculator.
func NewCacheSizeCalculator(shards Shard, interval time.Duration) *CacheSizeCalculator {
    return &CacheSizeCalculator{
        shards: shards,
        interval: interval,
        stopChan: make(chan struct{}),
    }
}

// Start starts the cache size calculation process.
func (c *CacheSizeCalculator) Start() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(c.interval)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for {
        select {
        case <-ticker.C:
            size := c.calculateCacheSize()
            c.mu.Lock()
            c.sizes = append(c.sizes, size)
            c.mu.Unlock()
        case <-c.stopChan:
            return
        }
    }
}

// Stop stops the cache size calculation process.
func (c *CacheSizeCalculator) Stop() {
    close(c.stopChan)
}

// GetSizes returns the calculated cache sizes.
func (c *CacheSizeCalculator) GetSizes() []int {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()
    return c.sizes
}

// calculateCacheSize calculates the total size of the cache.
func (c *CacheSizeCalculator) calculateCacheSize() int {
    totalSize := 0
    for _, shard := range c.shards {
        shard.RLock()
        totalSize += len(shard.store)
        shard.RUnlock()
    }
    return totalSize
}
```

### 2. Usage

You can create an instance of `CacheSizeCalculator` and start it to begin calculating the cache size at regular intervals.

```go
func main() {
    // Initialize your cache shards
    shards := New(4)

    // Initialize the CacheSizeCalculator with an interval of 1 minute
    calculator := NewCacheSizeCalculator(shards, time.Minute)
    
    // Start the cache size calculation process
    go calculator.Start()

    // Perform other operations in your program

    // Stop the cache size calculation process when no longer needed
    defer calculator.Stop()

    // Example: Retrieve cache sizes every 5 minutes
    ticker := time.NewTicker(5 * time.Minute)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for {
        select {
        case <-ticker.C:
            sizes := calculator.GetSizes()
            // Process/cache sizes as needed
            fmt.Println("Cache sizes:", sizes)
        }
    }
}
```

This approach allows you to periodically monitor the cache size and take actions based on the collected data. You can adjust the interval at which cache sizes are calculated according to your requirements.
